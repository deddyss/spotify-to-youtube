# Spotify to Youtube
Simple tool to export playlist from Spotify to Youtube

## About The Project
As a visual person I find watching video on Youtube more enjoyable than just listening to music in Spotify. Although I won't be watching videos all the time, only occasionaly. That's why I built this tool to help people like me enjoy their favorite music.
